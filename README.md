# SuperMarioVoice

This is a GAVPI profile for playing Super Mario Bros using your voice, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDT-QbFBLa0) by DougDoug. This is a novelty at best and is only really intended for you to get through 1-1.

![A screenshot of the MESEN emulator running Super Mario Bros. In addition, the GAVPI interface is shown with several voice commands active.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6349952/130362613-dc047d40-6f3d-48f0-8d52-2d7d1a445999.png)

## Set-up

### GAVPI

1. Download the latest release of [GAVPI](https://github.com/baykovr/AVPI).
2. Extract the archive, open the program.
3. Press File > Open Profile. Load the [`Super Mario Bros.xml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sevenanths/SuperMarioVoice/main/Super%20Mario%20Bros.XML) profile from this repository.
4. Press 'Listen'.
5. GAVPI will now listen for your commands. Note that the program exits to the tray, so if you want to close it, you have to right click its tray icon and choose 'Exit'.

### Emulator

1. Pray to Nintendo for the Super Mario Bros ROM. When left unanswered, find it yourself.
2. Fire up any NES emulator. I've chosen [MESEN](https://www.mesen.ca/). You can of course also use an SNES emulator such as [higan](https://higan.dev/) if you want to play Super Mario All-Stars.
3. Set up the player 1 controller as such:
    - Left: LEFT ARROW
    - Right: RIGHT ARROW
    - Start: ENTER
    - A: S
    
    The other buttons aren't mapped in this profile, since I didn't need them for getting through 1-1.
4. Load the ROM. Start the suffering.

## Commands

I have prepared the following commands in the profile. These are taken over from the DougDoug video. You will need most of these commands to finish the first stage. GAVPI is not instantaneous â€” there will be a delay between your command and the button input. Fun times!

- *start*  
  Presses START.
- *left*  
  Holds left for 1 second.
- *light left*  
  Holds left for 200 milliseconds.
- *super left*  
  Holds left for 100 milliseconds.
- *right*  
  Holds right for 1 second.
- *light right*  
  Holds right for 200 milliseconds.
- *super right*  
  Holds right for 100 milliseconds.
- *jump*  
  Presses A for 500 milliseconds.
- *rump*  
  Holds right and A for 1 second.
- *light rump*  
  Holds right and A for 200 milliseconds.
- *super rump*  
  Holds right and A for 100 milliseconds.
- *lump*  
  Holds left and A for 1 second.
- *light lump*  
  Holds left and A for 200 milliseconds.
- *super lump*  
  Holds left and A for 100 milliseconds.

## QOL upgrade

To stay sane, I suggest activating the Infinite Lives cheat (`SXIOPO`). This is a Game Genie cheat. It can be activated from Tools > Cheats.
